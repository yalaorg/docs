# The $YU Stablecoin

$YU is an over-collateralized stablecoin primarily backed by Bitcoin, designed to maintain a stable value relative to the US dollar. It leverages the robustness and decentralization of the Bitcoin network while enabling stablecoin transactions to settle on other chains.

### Key Features

* **Value Stability:** Soft-pegged to the US dollar, providing a reliable medium of exchange and store of value.
* **Bitcoin-Backed Security:** Utilizes Bitcoin as primary collateral, benefiting from the security and resilience of the Bitcoin network.
* **Yield Generation:** Holders can participate in various DeFi yield-generating opportunities.
* **Multi-Chain Compatibility:** Issued natively across multiple blockchain networks for enhanced utility and accessibility.
* **Permissionless Operation:** Users can create multiple vaults, deposit BTC, and mint $YU without restrictions.

### Key Advantages

* **Bitcoin Collateralization:** Enhances security and taps into Bitcoin's liquidity.
* **Cross-Chain Functionality:** Enables efficient operations across ecosystems without bridging Bitcoin.
* **User-Centric Yield Distribution:** Passes system-generated fees back to core $YU holders, unlike traditional stablecoins that retain profits centrally.
