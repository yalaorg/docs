# What is MetaMint and how does it work?

### Introduction <a href="#docs-internal-guid-516761f3-7fff-6830-5b0d-0bd336f98fb8" id="docs-internal-guid-516761f3-7fff-6830-5b0d-0bd336f98fb8"></a>

Bridging the gap between Bitcoin and EVM-compatible chains has long been a complex challenge in the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape. Enter MetaMint, a groundbreaking solution poised to transform users' interactions with cross-chain DeFi protocols.

### Defining MetaMint

MetaMint is a cross-chain protocol that facilitates the instant conversion of native Bitcoin into stablecoins on EVM-compatible chains, eliminating the need for intermediate wrapping steps and simplifying user interaction with DeFi platforms.

### The Current Landscape and Its Challenges

Traditionally, users looking to leverage their Bitcoin holdings in EVM-based DeFi ecosystems face a multi-step process:

1. Wrapping native Bitcoin into a BTC-pegged token on EVM chains
2. Interacting with protocols on destination chains using this wrapped asset

This approach not only introduces unnecessary complexity but also increases the potential for user error, creating a significant barrier to entry for many Bitcoin holders interested in exploring DeFi opportunities.

### How MetaMint Works

MetaMint addresses these challenges head-on, offering a streamlined, user-friendly solution for minting stablecoins directly from Bitcoin. Here's how it works:

1. **Direct BTC Utilization:** Users can use their native Bitcoin (BTC) to mint $YU, our stablecoin, without intermediate wrapping steps.
2. **One-Click Minting:** The process is condensed into a single, intuitive action, significantly reducing complexity.
3. **Automated Backend:** Complex operations are handled seamlessly behind the scenes, allowing users to focus on their financial goals rather than technical details.
4. **Cross-Chain Simplicity:** Users can effortlessly convert BTC to $YU on their chosen destination chain, opening up a world of DeFi opportunities.
