### Safety Measures in Yala MetaMint <a href="#docs-internal-guid-d87608d7-7fff-81bd-16c6-b53163d92f73" id="docs-internal-guid-d87608d7-7fff-81bd-16c6-b53163d92f73"></a>

**Handling Bridge Failures: Asset Returns**\
If the MetaMint process encounters an issue during the initial step of depositing BTC—specifically if the bridge fails to function correctly—Yala ensures that the user’s assets remain secure. The initially deposited Bitcoin will be returned to the user’s original wallet in such a scenario. This fail-safe mechanism is built into the process to guarantee that users do not lose access to their Bitcoin, maintaining trust and security throughout the Meta Mint process.

**Managing Minting Failures: yBTC in User Wallet**\
In cases where the minting process is not completed successfully, meaning yBTC wasn't successfully minted into $YU or used as intended, users will still retain their yBTC in their wallet. This ensures that users’ assets remain controlled, allowing them to attempt the minting process again or use yBTC for other purposes within the Yala protocol or other supported ecosystems. This approach safeguards user funds and provides flexibility, ensuring that assets are never lost and users can continue engaging with the protocol or withdraw their holdings as needed.

These safety measures are essential for maintaining user confidence in the protocol. They offer assurances that users' assets are protected and accessible at all stages of the Meta Mint process.&#x20;
