# Governance token $YALA

The $YALA token is a central element of the Yala credit system, designed to support and stabilize the platform during periods of financial stress and system stability. As a governance token, $YALA enables decentralized decision-making while also serving as a utility token and an overall system recapitalization resource.&#x20;

These roles ensure overall credit system stability through various mechanisms, including finetuning risk parameters, collateral management, and emergency measures. $YALA plays a critical role in maintaining the peg of $YU to the US dollar as a fallback resource and supports the broader functionality of the Yala credit system.

### Value Accrual

The value of the $YALA token is influenced by its role in maintaining the stability of the credit system and its long-term governance utility.

Additionally, $YALA holders benefit from participating in governance decisions that shape the platform’s future, such as adjusting risk parameters or enabling new collateral types. These decisions may influence the token’s long-term value.

### What Makes $YALA Different?

$YALA distinguishes itself from other governance tokens used across DeFi through its comprehensive role in platform stability and decentralized governance. The value and utility of $YALA are intrinsically associated with the financial health of the $YU stablecoin and Yala’s credit system.&#x20;

Here are some of the key differentiating factors:

**Utility Integration:** $YALA is used to access the Yala SDK, which includes critical components like the Oracle modules. This makes it essential for healthy cross-chain platform operations.

**Governance Balance:** Holders of $YALA have significant influence in decision-making, including voting on protocol changes, risk adjustments, and delegating voting rights. This ensures community-driven decisions and transparency. Alignment between $YALA holders is critical in preventing governance attacks and system instability.

## Core $YALA Features

The $YALA token is pivotal in the $YU stablecoin ecosystem, underpinning governance, utility, and financial stability.&#x20;

### Governance Voting

Governance voting is a central feature of $YALA, enabling holders to participate actively in the platform's decision-making processes. Through a decentralized governance model, $YALA holders can propose and vote on important protocol changes, such as:

* **Collateral Adjustments:** Proposals to add or modify collateral types within the ecosystem directly impact the stability and diversity of collateral backing $YU.
* **Risk Parameters:** Changes to risk parameters, such as the debt ceiling, collateralization ratios, and stability fees, are crucial for maintaining the balance between risk, reward, and collateral diversification.
* **Protocol Upgrades:** Decisions regarding technological improvements and system enhancements to ensure the platform remains secure and efficient.

Holders also have the option to delegate their voting rights to other users, allowing for broader representation and expertise in governance decisions.

### Utility in DeFi&#x20;

$YALA plays several essential roles across DeFi:

* **Access to SDK:** $YALA is used to pay for accessing the Yala SDK, which includes critical components such as the Oracle. This functionality supports the platform's operational integrity and integration with other DeFi applications.
* **Lending and staking**: Upon launch, $YALA will be available for lending and staking across DeFi markets. This will allow holders to earn rewards through yield farming activities beyond their direct participation in the Yala protocol’s success.

### System Emergency Shutdown

System Emergency Shutdown is a last-resort feature in the Yala protocol that ensures the system can handle very extreme emergency situations, such as a protocol hack, security breaches, or extreme market volatility. During an emergency shutdown, the protocol reallocates underlying collateral to Vault users and $YU holders proportionally and according to net assets at the time of initiation.&#x20;

* **Shutdown initiation:** $YALA holders can trigger an Emergency Shutdown by depositing $YALA into the system Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM). $YALA can equally vote on polls relating to initiating an emergency shutdown.
* **System redeployment:** Once an emergency shutdown is triggered, $YALA voters may decide to redeploy the system with adjusted parameters. Redeployment is an optional step, not an obligation for $YALA holders.
