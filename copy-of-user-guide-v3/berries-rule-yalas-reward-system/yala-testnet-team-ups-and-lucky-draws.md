# Yala Testnet: Team Ups & Lucky Draws

Introducing the Yala Testnet Team Up Functionality. With Team Up, explore the Yala testnet together with friends and earn prizes and bonuses along the way!&#x20;

Here’s how it works:&#x20;

1. Every testnet participant has a personal referral link. Users who join the Yala testnet using this link will automatically form a team, with the inviter as the team leader.&#x20;
2. Through ‘Lucky Draws’, teams can earn rewards in the form of blind boxes. Your team size determines the number and frequency of your ‘Lucky Draws’.&#x20;
3. ‘Lucky Draws’ give your team the chance to earn boxes of Berries, with the amount of Berries depending on the total amount of YU minted by the team.&#x20;

Build your team, open boxes and collect Berries!&#x20;

## Team Building

To build your team, share your Yala referral link with friends and followers. To find your referral link, visit ‘[Berries & Leaderboard](https://app-testnet.yala.org/berries)’. Get friends to sign up using your invite link to form a team (note that you make +15% of the Berries your friends make).



## Lucky Draw

Once you’ve built a team you will get access to ‘Lucky Draws’ - raffles which give you and your team members the chance to earn more Berries.

Only the team leader has permission to initiate the Lucky Draw. Here’s how to open it and what to expect:

1. Wait for the Countdown: Once the countdown reaches zero, the Lucky Draw button will become active.
2. Initiate the Draw: The team leader can click on the Lucky Draw button to begin.
3. View the Animation Page: After initiating the draw, an animation will display, showing your total Berries as well as your team’s total Berries.
4. Multiple Lucky Draws: If your team has accumulated more than one Lucky Draw, you can continue to open additional draws one after another.

Cooldown Reset: After initiating the Lucky Draw, the cooldown timer will reset, starting a new countdown until the next draw becomes available.

## Box Rewards Rule

The rewards from each blind box are based on the team’s rank in terms of the amount of YU minted. Depending on your team’s ranking percentage, each team member will receive a boost to their current total score as follows:

* If your team ranks below the top 50% (minted amount of YU is less than 50% of all teams), each blind box will increase each team member's current total score by 1%–5%.
* If your team ranks in the top 50%, each blind box will increase each team member's current total score by 6%–10%.
* If your team ranks in the top 30%, each blind box will increase each team member's current total score by 11%–15%.
* If your team ranks in the top 5%, each blind box will increase each team member's current total score by 16%–20%.



Note that：

When a user exceeds 10 million berries, the lucky draw can add up to 1 million berries at a time. When a user exceeds 20 million berries, the lucky draw can add up to 800,000 berries at a time.When a user exceeds 30 million berries, the lucky draw can add up to 600,000 berries at a time.

## Team Size and Box Opening Frequency

The frequency of lucky draws is determined by team size:

* Teams of 3–10 members can open 1 lucky draw every 168 hours.
* Teams of 11–20 members can open 2 lucky draws every 120 hours.
* Teams with more than 20 members can open 2 lucky draws every 72 hours.

## Example

Let’s say your team currently has 8 members with a total minted amount of YU that ranks them in the top 50%.

Lucky Boost Calculation

* Since your team is in the top 50%, each blind box opened will increase each team member’s current total score by 6%–10%. This boost will be applied to everyone on the team when a box is opened.
* If a team member has a total score of 1,000 points, opening a blind box would add a boost between 60 and 100 points (6%–10% of 1,000), depending on the exact draw percentage.

Lucky Draw Frequency

* With 8 members, the team qualifies to open 1 lucky draw every 168 hours (7 days). To increase the draw frequency, you can recruit more members.

## Tips

By improving your team rank (e.g., reaching the top 30%) or growing your team size, you can maximize both the boost percentage and draw frequency, enhancing the rewards for everyone.



## Lucky Draw Dashboard

1. Accessing Team Stats: This page displays detailed stats for your team’s progress. However, these stats are only visible if you are the team leader. If you haven’t invited any members to your team yet, the page will appear empty.
2. Team Information: Once you have a team, the page will show: Team Size: The total number of members in your team. Total YU Minted: The combined amount of YU minted by your team members. Team Rank: Your team’s rank compared to other teams based on YU minted.
3. Lucky Draw Countdown: The page includes a countdown timer for your next Lucky Draw, indicating when the team leader can initiate the next draw.
4. Boost Details: You’ll also find information on the current boost percentages that apply to each Lucky Draw, depending on your team’s rank. These boost percentages show how much each team member’s score will be increased when a Lucky Draw is opened.
