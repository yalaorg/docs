3.  Claim Rewards\


    Over time, Liquidation Gains and Token Rewards will accumulate. Liquidation gain is the collateral gain from the liquidation mechanism. When liquidations happen, then the collateral is distributed based on pool share. Token Rewards are the token reward gain and currently YU reward is distributed based on pool share and is updated every 30 seconds. When they are available, you can click Claim BTC or Claim YU, confirm the transaction in your wallet, and receive your rewards.
