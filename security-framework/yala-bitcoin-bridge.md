# Yala Bitcoin Bridge

### Core Design Principles

The Yala Bridge represents a significant advancement in cross-chain Bitcoin integration, designed specifically to address the fundamental security and centralization challenges inherent in traditional bridge implementations. Rather than relying on custodial mechanisms that compromise Bitcoin's security guarantees, our architecture implements a decentralized notary system with threshold cryptography to maintain Bitcoin's security properties throughout the bridging process. This enables users to access Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem using Bitcoin as collateral without sacrificing the core tenets of decentralization and self-custody that define the Bitcoin network.

### Technical Architecture

#### BTC Deposit & Cryptographic Attestation

The bridging process begins with a Bitcoin deposit flow that incorporates advanced cryptographic attestation techniques. Users initiate a Bitcoin transaction to a specially constructed P2WSH (Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash) address derived from a threshold signature scheme. This deposit transaction includes a cross-chain intent message encoded within the OP\_RETURN output field, cryptographically binding the deposit to the user's destination address on the target blockchain.

The critical security innovation here is that deposits do not require transferring custody to a central entity. Instead, the P2WSH script incorporates a time-locked recovery path that enables users to reclaim their Bitcoin after a predefined period should the bridge process fail. This provides a cryptographic guarantee of fund safety without requiring blind trust in the bridge operators.

#### Multi-Threshold Validation Framework

Post-deposit, our system employs a sophisticated multi-threshold validation framework managed through a distributed notary protocol:

1. **Deterministic Validator Selection**: Using a verifiable random function (VRF) derived from the Bitcoin block hash, the system programmatically selects a quorum of 9 from the 11 notary validators. This unpredictable selection mechanism prevents validator collusion and targeted attacks.
2. **Cross-Chain Attestation**: The selected notaries independently verify the Bitcoin transaction's inclusion and finality (requiring 6 confirmations) and cryptographically attest to this fact. These attestations are constructed using threshold signature schemes that prevent any individual notary from unilaterally authorizing minting operations.
3. **Multi-Stage Verification**: The validation process examines multiple cryptographic proofs: (a) existence of the Bitcoin UTXO, (b) proper script construction, (c) confirmation depth, and (d) destination address verification. All of these verifications occur through independent paths, creating a defense-in-depth validation framework.

### Cubist Hardware-Enshrined Smart Contract Implementation

The security foundation of the Yala Bridge relies on Cubist's innovative hardware-enshrined smart contract technology. Rather than traditional multisignature schemes or conventional MPC setups, we leverage Cubist's unique approach that brings smart contract-like guarantees to Bitcoin:

**Policy-Driven Key Management**: The Cubist implementation uses their CubeSigner technology to generate and store keys in secure hardware while enforcing sophisticated policies that control fund usage. These policies act as "smart contracts on Bitcoin," defining precisely how deposited funds can be used within the Yala ecosystem.

**Hardware Security Guarantees**: All cryptographic operations occur within secure hardware enclaves, ensuring that private keys never exist in plaintext memory and that all transactions must comply with predefined policy rules. This creates a cryptographic guarantee that funds can only follow authorized paths.

**Programmatic Fund Flow Control**: For Yala's bridge implementation, Cubist enforces critical rules such as: (1) deposited Bitcoin can only be used as collateral or returned to the original depositor, (2) governance changes require multi-party approval with time delays, and (3) specific transaction limits and timing constraints to mitigate attack scenarios.

**Built-in Recovery Mechanisms**: The policy framework includes mandatory time-locked recovery paths, ensuring users retain ultimate control over their Bitcoin. This creates a non-custodial bridge architecture where users don't have to trust Yala or any third party with permanent control of their assets.

#### YBTC Minting Process

Once validation is complete, the destination chain contract mints yBTC tokens (tokenized Bitcoin) to the user's specified address. This process incorporates several critical security features:

1. **Atomicity Guarantees**: The minting process is designed to be atomic—either completing fully or reverting entirely—preventing partial issuances that could lead to system inconsistencies.
2. **Supply Verification**: The contract maintains a cryptographic commitment to the total Bitcoin locked in the system, ensuring that yBTC can only be minted against verified Bitcoin deposits.
3. **Attestation Verification**: Before executing a mint operation, the contract cryptographically verifies that a valid threshold of notary signatures has been provided, preventing unauthorized minting.

### Security Considerations

Our bridge design specifically addresses the most critical attack vectors in cross-chain bridges:

1. **Bridge Compromise Resistance**: The threshold signature scheme ensures that even if a subset of notaries (up to n-t, or 2 in our 9-of-11 configuration) is compromised, the attacker cannot issue unauthorized mints or redirect funds.
2. **Chain Reorganization Protection**: The 6-confirmation requirement on Bitcoin deposits establishes a statistical guarantee against blockchain reorganization attacks, while the notary attestation process provides additional verification beyond mere confirmation count.
3. **Economic Security**: Notaries are required to stake significant collateral, creating an economic disincentive for malicious behavior that scales with the bridge's total value locked.
4. **Exit Path Guarantees**: Unlike many bridge designs, our architecture provides users with cryptographic guarantees for fund retrieval through time-locked recovery paths, ensuring that funds can be recovered even in catastrophic bridge failure scenarios.
