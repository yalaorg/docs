# Security Partnerships

The Yala Bridge's robust security framework is strengthened by strategic partnerships with industry-leading security providers. Each partner brings specialized expertise to different aspects of our security architecture:

### Custody & Key Management Partners

[**Cobo**](https://www.cobo.com/) provides enterprise-grade custody infrastructure with MPC-based key management that secures portions of the bridge's threshold signature system. Their HSM-backed security architecture and regulatory compliance framework adds an additional layer of protection for institutional depositors using the Yala Bridge.

**Anchorage Digital**, as a federally chartered digital asset bank, offers institutional-grade custody solutions that integrate with our bridge infrastructure. Their SOC 2 Type 1 compliant custody platform provides secure key storage with governance controls that enhance our security posture for regulated institutions.

**Cubist** powers our advanced threshold cryptography implementation with their state-of-the-art MPC framework. Their technology enables secure distributed key management without ever reconstructing complete private keys, implementing a 9-of-11 threshold signature scheme that maintains security even if individual nodes are compromised.

### Security Monitoring & Compliance

**TRM Labs** provides comprehensive blockchain intelligence and transaction monitoring across the bridge infrastructure. Their sanction screening and risk assessment tools enable real-time detection of suspicious activities and ensure regulatory compliance for all bridged assets.

### Data Availability & Infrastructure

**Nubit** enhances the Bitcoin data availability layer with their specialized Bitcoin-native DA solution. Their technology enables scalable, cost-efficient data storage secured by Bitcoin, providing critical infrastructure for transaction proofs and cross-chain verification data. This integration ensures that all bridge operations maintain complete data availability without overburdening the Bitcoin network.

### Security Auditing Partners

**FuzzLand** conducts specialized fuzzing and real-time monitor of our smart contracts, with particular focus on the cross-chain message verification and minting logic. Their automated vulnerability discovery tools have helped identify and remediate potential edge cases in our bridge implementation.

**Zenith** performs comprehensive security audits of both our on-chain components. Their expertise in cross-chain bridge security has been instrumental in validating our security architecture and ensuring adherence to best practices in bridge design.

**CoinFabrik** conducts comprehensive smart contract audits and security assessments of our protocol implementation. Their expertise in DeFi protocol security and specialized knowledge of cross-chain bridges provides additional validation of our security architecture, especially focusing on economic security models and incentive alignments in our bridge design.

Together, these partnerships create a defense-in-depth security strategy that addresses every aspect of bridge security—from key management and transaction validation to data availability, compliance monitoring, and security verification—providing users with industry-leading protection for their bridged assets.
