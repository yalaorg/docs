## Referral Program

You can boost your Berry count by referring others to Yala. Here’s how it works:

* Share your unique referral link with friends or within your network.
* Make sure the referee uses the correct referral link when signing up and connecting their wallet. You can earn Points if you complete tasks on the same blockchain as the referral link.
* Your Berry balance will increase by 15% of your friends' task rewards as they complete tasks and earn Berries.
