This unique feature lets users maintain their Bitcoin exposure while earning yields from various DeFi protocols.

3. **Security and Decentralization**: Leveraging Bitcoin's robust security model and employing advanced techniques like threshold signatures for Bitcoin vaults, Yala offers a secure and decentralized platform for DeFi activities.
4. **Seamless DeFi Experience**: Yala's modular approach brings the user-friendly DeFi experiences typically associated with Ethereum and other smart contract platforms to the Bitcoin ecosystem, bridging the functionality gap for Bitcoin holders.
5. **Community-Driven Governance**: With plans to transition to a DAO structure, Yala empowers its users to actively participate in shaping the future of Bitcoin DeFi, fostering a truly decentralized and community-driven ecosystem.
