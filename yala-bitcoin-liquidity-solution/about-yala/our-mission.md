# Our Mission

At Yala, our vision is to create a thriving, open ecosystem that unlocks the full potential of DeFi on Bitcoin.&#x20;

1. **Unleashing the untapped potential for Bitcoin assets:** Yala is committed to unlocking the full potential of DeFi on Bitcoin. With Bitcoin-backed Yu stablecoin, we will offer meta-yield from all other chains for Bitcoin holders.&#x20;
2. **Democratizing DeFi accessibility:** Our vision revolves around democratizing access to DeFi, enabling individuals and organizations to participate in a transparent, accessible, self-sovereign, decentralized financial system. We aim to foster an open ecosystem where diverse DeFi applications can seamlessly interoperate and compose, driving innovation, collaboration, and shared value creation.
3. **Embracing decentralized governance for the lending protocol:** At the core of our endeavor lies a commitment to decentralization and community governance. We strive to transition our lending protocol's governance structure into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), empowering the broader community to shape the Yala ecosystem's evolution actively. We aspire to create a self-sustaining, resilient, continuously evolving DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin through inclusivity and collective ownership.
4. **Pioneering Bitcoin's DeFi landscape:** Yala's ultimate goal is to establish itself as the preeminent DeFi infrastructure for Bitcoin. We envision a future where individuals and organizations can access a wide array of secure, transparent, and decentralized financial services, products, and opportunities within the Bitcoin ecosystem.&#x20;

Together, we will build the true DeFi ecosystem for Bitcoin, unlocking a world of possibilities and driving the mass adoption of decentralized finance on the world's most secure and resilient blockchain network.
