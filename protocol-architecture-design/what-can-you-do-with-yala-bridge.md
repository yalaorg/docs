Yala Bridge allows you to convert your Bitcoin into YU, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, by overcollateralizing your BTC. Here’s how it works:

* **Mint $YU**: Send your BTC to Yala’s designated Bitcoin Receiver Address, and mint up to 75% of the BTC’s value in YU on the destination blockchain. YU provides a stable asset that you can use across various DeFi platforms.

When you’re ready to reclaim your BTC, Yala Bridge makes it easy:

* **Burn YU and Receive BTC**: If you want to withdraw your Bitcoin, create a burn transaction on the destination chain where you hold YU. Once your YU is burned, Yala Bridge will release the BTC and send it to your specified Bitcoin address.
