## RISK NOTICE

Please read this entire section carefully as it contains important information pertaining to risks associated with $YU, our Website, and products and services.

You are strongly advised to take independent legal advice on whether you are permitted under the laws of  your jurisdiction to purchase $YU and/or utilize the products and services.

We do not recommend that you purchase $YU or utilize the products and services unless you have prior experience with cryptographic tokens, blockchain-based software and distributed ledger technology and unless you have taken independent professional advice (including legal advice, tax advice and other relevant professional advice).

You agree that you are solely responsible for making your own independent investigation and appraisal of the products and services offered on our Website. You shall fully understand and familiarize yourself with all the terms and conditions of the products and services, and the risks involved. You agree that you will only utilize the products and services on the basis of your own independent review and determination that the same are suitable and appropriate for you, taking into account your specific objectives, financial situation, experience, knowledge and particular needs.

You expressly acknowledge that you have the appetite to assume all economic consequences and risks of utilizing the products and services and to the extent necessary, have obtained consultation from tax, legal and other advisers.

## REGULATORY RISKS&#x20;

### (a) Regulatory status uncertain

The regulation of digital tokens and/or cryptocurrencies such as $YU and the accompanying decentralized products and services is still in a very nascent stage of development globally. There exists a high degree of uncertainty as to how tokens and token-related activities are to be treated. The applicable legal and regulatory framework may change subsequent to the date of which you obtain $YU or interact with any of the products and services offered on our Website. Such change may be very rapid and it is not possible to anticipate with any degree of certainty the nature of such regulatory evolution. We do not in any way represent that the regulatory status of $YU and the accompanying products and services will remain unaffected by any regulatory changes that arise at any point in time before, during, and after your utilisation of the same.

### (b) No regulatory supervision

We are not currently regulated or subject to the supervision of any regulatory body, we are not registered in any jurisdiction as any type of regulated financial institution or financial advisor and are not subject to the standards imposed upon such persons under any regulatory instrument. Such persons are required to comply with a variety of requirements and standards concerning disclosures, reporting, compliance, and conduct of their operations for purposes or maximizing investor protections. Since we are not subject to such requirements or standards, we will make decisions on those issues at our own discretion. While we will have regard to best practices for these issues, you will not necessarily enjoy the same extent and degree of investor or consumer protections as would be the case should you purchase/interact with products or services from regulated entities instead.

### (c) No fiduciary duties owed

As we are not a regulated financial institution, we do not owe you any fiduciary duties. This means that we have no legal obligation to always act in good faith in the best interests of you. While we will have regard to the interests of you, it is also permitted to consider the interests of other key stakeholders and to prefer these interests over yours. This may mean that we are permitted to make decisions that conflict with or are not necessarily in your interests. Not owing any fiduciary duties also means that you may have limited rights of recourse against the us in the event of disputes.

### (d) Uncertainties in tax characterisation and tax treatment

The tax characterization of digital tokens, digital assets and cryptocurrencies (such as $YU) is unclear. Accordingly, the tax treatment to which they will be subject is uncertain. All persons who wish to obtain $YU or utilize their digital assets/tokens for the purposes of interacting with our products and services should seek independent tax advice prior to deciding whether to obtain $YU or interact with the accompanying products and services offered on our Website. We make no representation as to whether any tax consequences may arise from holding $YU and/or the utilization of the products and services as set out on our Website.

### (e) Failure to obtain, maintain or renew licenses and permits

Although as of the date of this Terms of Use, we are not obliged under any statutory requirements to receive any licenses and permits necessary for carrying out our activities, there is the risk that such statutory requirements may be adopted in the future. In this case, our business will depend on the continuing validity of such licenses and permits and its compliance with their terms. Regulatory authorities will exercise considerable discretion in the timing of license issuance and renewal and the monitoring of licensees’ compliance with license terms. Requirements which may be imposed by these authorities and which may require us to comply with numerous standards, recruit qualified personnel, maintain necessary technical equipment and quality control systems, monitor our operations, maintain appropriate filings and, upon request, submit appropriate information to the licensing authorities, may be costly and time consuming and may result in delays in the continuation of operation of our activities. Further, private individuals and the public at large possess rights to comment on and otherwise engage in the licensing process, including through intervention in courts and political pressure. Accordingly, the licenses we may need may not be issued or renewed, or if issued or renewed, may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion, or may involve requirements which restrict our ability to conduct our operations or to do so profitably.

### (f) Unlawful or arbitrary government action

Governmental authorities may have a high degree of discretion and, at times, act selectively or arbitrarily, without hearing or prior notice, and sometimes in a manner that is contrary to law or influenced by political or commercial considerations. Moreover, the government also has the power in certain circumstances, by regulation or government act, to interfere with the performance of, nullify or terminate contracts. Unlawful, selective or arbitrary governmental actions have reportedly included the denial or withdrawal of licenses, sudden and unexpected tax audits, criminal prosecutions and civil actions. Government entities in other jurisdictions have also used common defects in matters surrounding token sales as pretexts for court claims and other demands to invalidate or to void any related transaction, often for political purposes. In this environment, our competitors may receive preferential treatment from the government, potentially giving them a competitive advantage against us.

## PRODUCT RISKS

### (a)  Attributes or functionalities or features

We neither guarantee nor represent in any way that your holding of $YU and the utility of the products and services on our Website will entitle you to any rights, uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features. We reserve the right (in its sole and absolute discretion), to amend the uses, purposes, attributes, functionalities or features of $YU and the accompanying products and services.

### (b) Risk of enterprise failure

There is no assurance of any success or development of the $YU tokens and the products and services offered on our Website.  The aforementioned are in a constant state of development and are subject to further changes, updates and adjustments. Such changes may result in unexpected and unforeseen delays and impact. There is no assurance that the $YU tokens and accompanying products and services will be adopted or utilized by its target users and therefore, there exists the risk of enterprise failure.  &#x20;

### (c) Lack of development of market for $YU

There may not be an active or liquid market for $YU, and the price may be highly volatile. Even if $YU is tradable in a secondary market, in practice, there may not be enough active buyers and sellers or the bid-ask spreads may be too wide. Accordingly, you may not be able to exit your token holdings easily. In the worst-case scenario where no secondary market develops, a token holder may not be able to liquidate his/her token holdings at all.

## THIRD PARTY RISKS

The tokenized/decentralised nature of $YU and the products and services means that they are blockchain based. The security, transferability, storage, and accessibility of blockchain assets depends on factors outside of our control, such as the security, stability, and suitability of the underlying blockchain, mining disruptions, and who has access to the private key of any wallet where your $YU are stored. We do not represent or otherwise assure that we can prevent such external factors from having any direct or indirect adverse impact on any $YU and/or the products and services. Persons intending to purchase $YU or utilize the products and services should note that adverse events caused by such external factors may result in the loss of some or all $YU purchased and/or other cryptocurrencies utilized by way of the products and services. Such loss may be irreversible. We are not responsible for taking steps to recover any cryptocurrencies or digital tokens lost.

## BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY RISKS

Our dependence on functioning software applications, computer hardware, underlying blockchain technology and the internet implies that we can offer no assurances that a system failure would not adversely affect the use of your $YU and/or the products and services. Despite our implementation of all reasonable network security measures, our processing servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or other disruptions of a similar nature. Computer viruses, break-ins or other disruptions caused by third parties may result in interruption, delay or suspension of services, which would limit the use of $YU and/or the products and services.
